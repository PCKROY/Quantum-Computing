Question of Assignment WQ6 :- Implement a Multi-Control-X

Task A: Synthesize 3 different implementations of an MCX (multi-control-x) with 5 control qubits and 1 target qubit (you should use the control quantum operation for implementing an MCX, 
follow this___Links to an external site. tutorial that can be open in the IDE).
One implementation should be optimized for minimized depth, the other for minimized width, and the third somewhere in between (choose yourself what is the maximal width / depth you apply).
Export the 3 implementations as LaTeX files on the hierarchy level that demonstrates the differences between the implementations. 
Aggregate the implementations in 1 file and export it as a PDF and explain the key differences. (It is recommended to use OverleafLinks to an external site, a free, easy to use online LaTeX editor)

Task B: Synthesize 2 different implementations of an MCX (multi-control-x) with 20 control qubits and 1 target qubit. Compare the circuit width and circuit depth required for each implementation.


Question of Assignment WQ6-8:- 
Assignment:
Code the algorithm of the Hadamard test that we covered in class using the Python SDK (below is a print screen of the Qmod for your convenience). 
Execute it from the SDK using 1,000 , 2,000 , 4,000 , 8,000 and 16,000 shots, and for each job calculate the (real part of the) expectation value using the formula 

Re{ < 0 | Uqft | 0 > } = 2Po - 1

Plot a graph of the expectation value as a function of the number of shots. Add the theoretical value to the graph. Explain the results.


Question of Assignment WQ6-10:- 
Apply the non-unitary matrix ((1,0), (0,0))
on a 1-qubit quantum state which has a 0.3 probability being measured in the zero state |0.


Question of Assignment hw4:- 
A. Create a well-detailed Python Jupyter notebook that explains your algorithm, including the code parts covered in class, and pictures/figures where relevant.

Utilize the Python code from class: quantum_walk_circle_example.py Links to an external site.. It can be found directly also in the Classiq Git Library in the community/womanium/assignmentsLinks to an external site. folder.
Feel free to extend the example beyond the requirements here and what was covered in class.

B. Contribute your notebook to the Classiq Git LibraryLinks to an external site. to the folder community/womanium/assignments Links to an external site.

Follow the contribution guidelines Links to an external site.  in order to contribute - NO need to open an issue for this, you can directly open a PR
The PR title should be: Womanium Final Assignment - <First Name> <Last Name>
The file name should be in the following format: <first_name>_<last_name>_hw4.ipynb
