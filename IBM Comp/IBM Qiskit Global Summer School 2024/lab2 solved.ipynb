        "In this lab we will show a guided construction of how to calculate the EPLG (Error Per Layered Gate) and LF (Layer Fidelity). These metrics quantify error rates in a circuit, and are particularly useful in understanding the overhead required to run error mitigation at utility-scale workloads.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more details on the background of these metrics, see the [Quantum Research Blog post](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/quantum-metric-layer-fidelity) or the associated technical paper, [Benchmarking Quantum Processor Performance at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05933). You can also find an implementation of the Layer Fidelity experiment [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-device-benchmarking/blob/main/notebooks/layer_fidelity.ipynb) using `qiskit-experiments` module, whereas, in this notebook, we will directly use Qiskit Runtime Primitives for circuit execution.\n",

        "- In Section 0 we list the package requirement to run this notebook.\n",
        "- In Sections 1-3 we will set up the layers and associated circuits which define the disjoint sets of qubits on which we will perform EPLG calculations.\n",
        "- In Section 4 we construct the total EPLG circuits.\n",
        "- In Section 5-7 we construct the `BindingsArray`, `ObservablesArray`s, and `EstimatorPub`s for the EPLG characterization.\n",
        "- In Section 8 we submit these to the `EstimatorV2` Qiskit Runtime Primitive.\n",
        "- In Section 9 we perform the data analysis and fittings used to extract the EPLG and LF with the resulting data."

For a circuit of depth $d$ (for even $d$), we randomly sample 1q Clifford gates for $d/2$ layers, and then we invert the circuit for the last $d/2$ layers. This provides a simple implmentation for our purposes, and the details of this difference are beyond the scope of this lab.\n",
        "2. We perform 1q Clifford sampling by taking advantage of the fact that for backends whose single qubit gates are composed of $R_z(\\theta_1) \\sqrt{X} R_z(\\theta_2) \\sqrt{X} R_z(\\theta_3)$, when $\\theta_i \\in \\{ \\pm \\pi / 2, \\pm \\pi, 0 \\}$, the resulting single qubit gate is a Clifford. This allows us to randomly sample 1q Clifford gates simply by changing parameters."
